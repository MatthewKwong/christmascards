        <h1>Dear Christine,</h1>

        <p>Thank you for all the laughs and memories this past year! Whether that be talking about Alex-hole or killing flies at 3am I really enjoy those crazy conversations. You're not only artistic, but hilarious as well. I thoroughly appreciate all the
            puns and inside jokes we've created. Keep being you and kick butt. I can't wait to hear about all your success at clown / plumbing school.</p>

        <p>Have a great winter break with your friends and family.

            <p>Best wishes,</p>

            <p>Matthew</p>
