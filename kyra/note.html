        <h1>Happy 17th birthday! Thank you for everthing these past years, 
        whether that be sending me memes or helping me in math, I appreciate it.
        Thank you for all the laughs and memories these past 4 years of high school
        as it wouldn't be the same without you.
        You're one of the coolest people I know and I'm glad to call you a friend.
        I hope you have an amazing day today with your friends and family.
    </h1>
    
    <h1>Have a great one and keep being you,</h1>
