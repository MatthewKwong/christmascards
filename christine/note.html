		<h1>Dear Christine,</h1>
		
		<p>Thank you for all the laughs and memories this past year!  Whether that be talking about 
		Alex-hole or killing flies at 3am I really enjoy those crazy conversations. You're not only artistic, but hilarious
		as well. I thoroughly appreciate all the puns and inside jokes we've created. Keep being you and kick butt. 
		I can't wait to hear about all your success at clown / plumbing school.</p>
		
		<p>Have a great winter break with your friends and family. 
		
		<p>Best wishes,</p>

		<p>Matthew</p>
