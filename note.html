        <h1>Dear , </h1>
        <p>I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and an even better year in 2017. 
        You deserve the best this holiday season and should hold Glory in all that you've
        accomplished even if you Faked It. This is going to be the Winter of Our Youth because
        Way Beyond this year we'll be graduating High school and moving to a bigger Campus. 
        Good Grief! I'm so glad that despite all The Currents this year, you're still with me in this Wild World.
        Despite all the Shame I bring, I appreciate the Act(s) of Kindness. 
        Thank you for being The Anchor of my life, making a lesser of Two Evils.
        I Blame you for breaking the Four Walls we call life, as the world wouldn't be the same without you.
        The world is full of Snakes struggling with Lethargy. However, like Oil on Water, you separate 
        from everyone else with your creativity. Through your Power I know you'll be able to Send Them Off, 
        showing the world a new perspective of science and art.</p>
        
        <p>In all seriousness, I hope you have a wonderful Winter Break with your family
        and friends during the holidays. I truly am grateful for everything you do and will never forget it.</p>
            
        <p>Have a fantastic holiday season,</p>
        
        
        <p>Matthew</p>
        
        <p>P.S. Keep Warmth</p>
